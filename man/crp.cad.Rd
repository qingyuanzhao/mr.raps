\title{Effect of C-Reactive Protein on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 1575 rows and 30 variables.
}
\usage{
data(crp.cad)
}
\description{
This dataset is created from three genome-wide association studies:
\enumerate{
\item Prins et al.\ (2017) GWAS of CRP.
\item Dehghan et al.\ (2011) GWAS of CRP
\item The CARDIoGRAMplusC4D GWAS of CAD.
}
To obtain this dataset, the Prins study is used for SNP selection (column \code{pval.selection}). The Dehghan dataset estimates the SNPs' effect on CRP and the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D dataset estimates the SNPs' on CAD.
